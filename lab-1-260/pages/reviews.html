  <p class = "reviews">"I couldn't be happier with Ellie's work. I asked her to take pictures of my hometown for me to hang on my caf√© walls. <br>Not only are the pictures beautiful and scenic, they perfectly capture the feelings of the town I love. I will definitely be contacting her again" <br> -Lana Linfield</p>
  <br>
  <p class = "reviews">"Ellie warned me when I asked her to take my family pictures that she doesn't often work with families. However, she agreed <br> to do it, and the result was amazing. For someone who takes mostly scenic pictures, I think she did a great job with taking my family's pictures." <br> -Adam Young</p>
  <br>
  <p class = "reviews">"When my husband and I started to plan our most recent trip to Europe, we knew we had to invite Ellie. Not only is she a good <br> friend of ours, but we knew we would get beautiful pictures from the trip as well. Even though I've known her for years, I was amazed at the <br> way she could imagine what a
    picture would look like in her mind. Oftentimes, she asked us to pose in awkward-feeling poses, but we ended <br>up loving those pictures the best. Not only did we love the experience of traveling with her and her husband, we adore all of our new pictures too" <br> -Mandy Poller</p>
  <br>
  <p class = "reviews">"We loved the pictures and the experience. Definitely will work with Ellie again."<br>-Samuel Grey</p>
  <br>
  <p class = "reviews">"I haven't actually worked with Ms. Van De Graaff in person, but I love her pictures. I attended a photography auction to choose <br> some art when my company was redecorating our office, and her work just jumped out at me. It is simple yet beautiful, <br> and everyone in the office has enjoyed and still
    does enjoy admiring the views she has brought into our office. I hope to meet her in <br>person soon, and I will definitely be looking for more of her work!"<br>-Olivia Newton</p>
